            question: "How are submissions evaluated?",
            answer: <p>
                Submissions are evaluated in two rounds based on criteria such as technical implementation, relevance, innovation, usability, and potential impact. 
The top ten teams will make it to the Finale, where judges will determine the winners by considering both their presentations and their earlier submission scores.
            </p>
        },
        {
            question: "What is required to make a submission?",
            answer: <p>
                All teams must submit their project on Devpost. Your submission must include:
Project title and short description
Detailed project description (Fill in project_information.docx with all fields filled and rename to team_name.docx)
Public GitHub link with a clear README and all relevant files
Demo video (max 10 mins) hosted on YouTube and linked on Devpost
Only one member needs to submit the project on Devpost, but all team members must be tagged as contributors.
Judges will evaluate your submission directly from your Devpost project page.
            </p>

            question: "What if I can't attend every day?",
            answer: <p>
                Attending the Opening Day on 16 June is mandatory, as the problem statement will be released during the opening ceremony. Day 2 and 3 (17â€“18 June) will be conducted virtually for project development. The Finale on 19 June will be held physically, and finalist teams must have at least one member present during their pitch.
