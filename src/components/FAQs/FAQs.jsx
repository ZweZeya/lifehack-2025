            question: "How are submissions evaluated?",
            answer: <p>
                Submissions are judged over three rounds.
                Judging criteria include technical implementation, relevance, innovation, usability, and potential impact.
                <ul>
                    <li>In Round 2, selected teams will be invited to pitch their hacks live.</li>
                    <li>In Round 3, the top ten finalists will face off in the finale, and judges will decide the winners based on both presentation and earlier submission scores.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        },
        {
            question: "What is required to make a submission?",
            answer: <p>
                Teams are required to submit their solution via a Google Form that will be provided on the submission day.
                Each submission must include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A public GitHub repository link (if applicable)</li>
                    <li>A demo video with a maximum duration of 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>
                        A written description of the project that addresses the following questions:
                        <ol>
                            <br />
                            <li>What is your project called?</li>
                            <li>What problem statement are you addressing?</li>
                            <li>How does your solution tackle the problem?</li>
                            <li>How did you build it?</li>
                            <li>Additionally, if GitHub is used, the submission must include a README.md file, as well as any other relevant files that are not included in the repository</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            
        },
        {
            question: "What if I can't attend every day?",
            answer: <p>
                While attending the full event is encouraged, it's not mandatory to be present every day.
                However, to qualify for the lucky draw, you must attend both the Opening Day (16 June) and at least one workshop.
                Teams are still eligible to submit their hacks as long as they meet the submission deadline and follow the event rules.
                Round 2 and finalists must have at least one team member present during their respective pitches.
